# 625.721-Poisson-Mixtures-Final-Project
A study of Poisson Mixtures used to model word count data.


My starting point for the project was the first paper on Poisson distributions and I have focused on the literature connected to that paper that models word count data using Poisson mixtures. For my paper I have implemented several of the proposed Poisson mixtures from the literature and discussed their pros and cons, specifically within the realm of applications to natural language processing. 

I am comparing the results using several measures of variability including Entropy and Burstiness and discuss overdispersion. I am also comparing the distributions with the chi-squared goodness-of-fit test and include a discussion of parameter estimation using the method of maximum likelihood estimation.
